# Information

This is a continuation of RDMMonitor by Chuckslove <https://github.com/chuckleslove/RDMMonitor>. We will continue to improve this repo where needed and keep it alive in his memory.

RDMDeviceMonitor is a simple discord bot to monitor device status for RDM.

<hr />

# SETTING UP THE BOT:

1. Download `Node.js ver v12.18.3` from https://nodejs.org/en/download/

2. Run `git clone https://github.com/Kneckter/RDMMonitor` to copy the bot.

3. Change into the new folder `cd RDMMonitor/`.

4. Run `npm install`.

5. Copy the example file `cp RDMMonitorConfig.example.json RDMMonitorConfig.json`.

6. Create an applicaiton and get the your bot's secret token, and application ID at:
   * https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me

7. Get your application/bot to join your server by going here:
   * https://discordapp.com/developers/tools/permissions-calculator
   * Check the boxes for the needed permissions
     * Minimum requirements: manage messages, send messages, read message history
   * Use the URL that the page generates and go to it, and you will be asked to log into your discord. You will need **Admin** access in order to get the bot to join that server.

8. Fill out the information needed in `nano RDMMonitorConfig.json`.

--`.restart`   »   to manually restart the whole bot<br>
--`.reopen <DEVICE-NAMES>`   »   to reopen the game on specific devices<br>
--`.reboot <DEVICE-NAMES>`   »   to reboot the specific devices<br>

Reopen and reboot accept multiple names separated by commas.<br>

They can accept `all`, `allwarn`, or `alloff` to apply to groups but will omit devices on the exclude lists.
